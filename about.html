    <p>
        I hail from Siaya County in the deep roots of Rarieda. Having been brought up in a steady Christian family, I have deep love for family and people. After highschool I wanted to work in the hospital therefore I went for a degree in Clinical Medicine. After successfully completing and a further internship, I still had a hollow space in my soul with a deep longing for something different, something that would make me be comfortable everyday, wake up to doing something that I like and through that, an idea of tech was born in me.
        I plan to make a switch to tech and become a developer, this coupled with other web based projects will fill the hole left in my soul and I beleive will help me achieve my overall purpose for existence at such a beautiful time.
